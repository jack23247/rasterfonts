**rasterfonts** is an effort to reproduce classic computer raster fonts and allow them to be used in modern contexts, by creating readily-available, pixel-perfect recreations that look exactly alike.

## Tools

The fonts, for now, are being created using [BITFONTMAKER2](http://www.pentacom.jp/pentacom/bitfontmaker2/#). 

## Repository

The repository is organized as follows:

- `/`

  - `tools` - A folder housing various scripts and tools
    - `ascii.sh` - A script used to create the font previews
- `<font_name>` - A folder containing the source and release files of a specific font
    - `<font_name>.ttf` - The release TrueType font file
    - `<font_name>.txt` - The BFM2 source
    -  `<font_name>.png` - A screenshot generated by `ascii.sh`
    - `README.md` - A read-me file specific to the font

## Fonts

Here follows a list of currently available fonts

| Name    | Version    | Description                                               |

## License

Each font recreation's source code is available under the Espresso license, as most of them (if not all) should be in the public domain and not covered by active patents at the moment. If you hold the copyright to one of these fonts and feel like this project is damaging you and/or your company feel free to open an issue and the offending files will be removed.
