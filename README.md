**rasterfonts** is an effort to reproduce classic computer raster fonts and allow them to be used in modern contexts, by creating readily-available, pixel-perfect recreations that look exactly alike.

## Tools

The fonts, for now, are being created using [BITFONTMAKER2](http://www.pentacom.jp/pentacom/bitfontmaker2/#). 

## Repository

The repository is organized as follows:

- `/`
- `tools` - A folder housing various scripts and tools
    - `ascii.sh` - A script used to create the font previews
- `<font_name>` - A folder containing the source and release files of a specific font
    - `<font_name>.ttf` - The release TrueType font file
    - `<font_name>.txt` - The BFM2 source
    -  `<font_name>.png` - A screenshot of the output generated by `ascii.sh`
    - `README.md` - A read-me file specific to the font

## Fonts

Here follows a list of currently available fonts
