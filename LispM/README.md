An attempt to recreate the first Lisp Machine's font, named `CPTFONT` in the MIT CADR operating system.

You can read more about the CADR [here](https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/5718), while [this site](http://www.unlambda.com/cadr/) hosts a simulator you can quite easily build under *nix and Windows systems and lots of documentation.

## Metrics

| Width [px] | Height [px] | Spacing [px] |
| ---------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| 8, fixed   | 12          | 2            |

## Progress

The whole base character set has been implemented. Some extended characters need more work but none is planned at the moment.

## Authors

This font was created in 1979 by the MIT AI Lab for their Knight and CADR machines' operating system, and it was hereby traced and reproduced in September 2020.
