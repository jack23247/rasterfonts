## Metrics

| Width [px] | Height [px] | Spacing [px] |
| ---------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| 8, fixed   | 12          | 2            |

## Progress

The whole base character set has been implemented. Some extended characters need more work but none is planned at the moment.

## Authors

This font was created by the MIT AI Lab for their Knight and CADR machines' operating system, and it was initially traced and reproduced by Jacopo Maltagliati in september 2020.
