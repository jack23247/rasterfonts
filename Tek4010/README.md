You can read more about the Tektronix 4010 [here](http://www.pdp8online.com/tek4010/tek4010.shtml), it even hosts [very useful manual pages](ftp://ftp.pdp8online.com/misc/4010/). An emulator for *nix systems is available [here](https://github.com/rricharz/Tek4010), and it can be patched to support this font.

## Metrics

| Width [px] | Height [px] | Spacing [px] |

## Progress

The [4010 maintenace manual, section 2](ftp://ftp.pdp8online.com/misc/4010/sect2.pdf) lists only 64 glyphs: so far it's been completely implemented. Some useful characters are missing, most notably, `{`, `}`, `'` and `~`: I have designed those glyphs myself. 

## Authors

This font was created by Tektronix for their 4010 storage tube terminal, and it was initially traced, reproduced  and extended by Jacopo Maltagliati in september 2020.
