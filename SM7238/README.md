An attempt to recreate the font of the soviet Elektronika SM 7238 (Электроника СМ 7238) VT220-compatible terminal.

The SM7238 is famous because it was a common frontend to the Elektronika DVK-2 computer, a member of the family of PDP-11 clones on which TETRIS was developed.

## Progress

There is a glyph test page on the [MAME wiki](https://wiki.mamedev.org/index.php/Driver:Soviet_terminals) (yes, MAME emulates this thing down to the annoying *beeps*). Only the base character set has been traced, and some characters, like the tilde, have been redesigned. I've decided to keep a little, very "советский" quirk of the character set: the `$` sign is absent! A smaller version of the currency sign (`¤`) replaces it.

## Authors

This font was created by Elektronika in 1989 and it was hereby traced, reproduced and extended for the first time in January 2021.
